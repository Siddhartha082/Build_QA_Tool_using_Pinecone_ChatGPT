Creating a Streamlit application that allows you to search and query PDF documents effortlessly. Using cutting-edge technologies such as Pinecone and LLM (OpenAI's ChatGPT), I guide you step-by-step in harnessing the potential of these tools.

By leveraging Pinecone as a vector database and search engine, we enable lightning-fast search capabilities for PDF documents. Additionally, we employ LLM to enhance the search functionality with question-answering capabilities, making your app even more versatile and intelligent.

To ensure smooth data preprocessing, chains, and other essential tasks, we utilize the incredible Langchain framework. With its powerful features, Langchain simplifies and streamlines the development process, enabling you to focus on building an exceptional PDF query search app.

Whether a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to building your own Streamlit app with Pinecone, LLM, and Langchain. Join me as we dive deep into natural language processing and create a game-changing application together!
